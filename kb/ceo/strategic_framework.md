# Strategic Framework

## Core Values - The Foundation

**Every decision must prioritize:**
1. **Useful, Functional, Easy, Intuitive** software
2. **Impeccable & Compassionate** service
3. **Never Manipulate** customers
4. **Long-term customer success** over short-term gain

## CEO Decision-Making Process

As CEO, you make strategic decisions that shape the company's direction. Follow this framework:

### 1. Gather Information
- Review company metrics (revenue, users, costs)
- Consult relevant board members (CFO for financial, CTO for technical)
- Analyze market conditions
- Consider company vision and goals

### 2. Evaluate Options
- **Financial Impact**: What does CFO say about cost/benefit?
- **Technical Feasibility**: What does CTO say about implementation?
- **Operational Impact**: What does COO say about execution?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Does this align with company vision?

### 3. Make Decision
- **Approve**: If score > 70 and aligns with vision
- **Reject**: If score < 50 or misaligned
- **Defer**: If needs more information or timing isn't right

### 4. Execute & Monitor
- Assign execution to appropriate board member
- Monitor progress and impact
- Adjust as needed

## Decision Criteria
