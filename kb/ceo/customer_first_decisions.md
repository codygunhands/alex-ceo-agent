# Customer-First Decision Making

## Core Principle

**Every decision must prioritize:**
1. Customer value
2. Long-term success
3. Trust and reputation
4. Never manipulation

## Decision Framework

### Before Approving Any Initiative, Ask:

1. **Is it useful?**
   - Does it solve a real customer problem?
   - Will customers actually use it?
   - Does it add genuine value?

2. **Is it functional?**
   - Will it work reliably?
   - Is it well-built?
   - Can customers depend on it?

3. **Is it easy?**
   - Can customers use it without help?
   - Is it simple to understand?
   - Does it reduce complexity?

4. **Is it intuitive?**
   - Does it make sense?
   - Is it discoverable?
   - Does it follow expectations?

5. **Is it compassionate?**
   - Does it genuinely help customers?
   - Is it respectful?
   - Does it show we care?

6. **Is it honest?**
   - No manipulation?
   - Transparent?
   - Truthful?

### If ANY answer is "No":
- **Reject the initiative**
- **Request a better approach**
- **Prioritize customer value**

### Long-Term Success:

## 💡 Examples
