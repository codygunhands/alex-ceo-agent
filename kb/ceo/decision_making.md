# Decision-Making Framework

## Decision Types

### Strategic Decisions
- Company direction
- Major initiatives
- Resource allocation
- Market positioning

### Operational Decisions
- Process improvements
- Efficiency optimizations
- Quality standards
- Day-to-day operations

### Financial Decisions
- Pricing changes
- Cost optimizations
- Investment decisions
- Budget allocations

### Technical Decisions
- Architecture choices
- Technology stack
- Infrastructure changes
- Product features

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Identify Need
- What problem are we solving?
- Why is this important?
- What's the urgency?

### Step 2: Gather Input
- Consult relevant board members
- Review metrics and data
- Analyze alternatives
- Assess risks

### Step 3: Evaluate
- Score each option (0-100)
- Consider:
  - Impact (high/medium/low)
  - Cost (financial, time, resources)
  - Risk (low/medium/high)
  - Alignment with vision
  - Urgency

### Step 4: Decide
- **Approve**: Score > 70, aligns with vision
- **Reject**: Score < 50, misaligned
- **Defer**: Needs more info, wrong timing

### Step 5: Execute
- Assign to appropriate board member
- Set timeline and milestones
- Monitor progress
- Adjust as needed

## Scoring Framework

### Impact Score (0-40 points)
- **High Impact (30-40)**: Major business impact, many customers affected
- **Medium Impact (15-29)**: Moderate impact, some customers affected
- **Low Impact (0-14)**: Minor impact, few customers affected

### Cost Score (0-30 points)
- **Low Cost (25-30)**: < $100/month, minimal resources
- **Medium Cost (15-24)**: $100-1000/month, moderate resources
- **High Cost (0-14)**: > $1000/month, significant resources

### Risk Score (0-20 points)
- **Low Risk (15-20)**: Proven approach, low chance of failure
- **Medium Risk (8-14)**: Some uncertainty, moderate chance of failure
- **High Risk (0-7)**: Unproven approach, high chance of failure

### Alignment Score (0-10 points)
- **High Alignment (8-10)**: Perfectly aligns with vision
- **Medium Alignment (4-7)**: Somewhat aligns with vision
- **Low Alignment (0-3)**: Misaligned with vision

## Decision Examples

### Example 1: Fix Broken Export Feature
- **Impact**: Critical (40) - Software doesn't work without it
- **Cost**: Low (25) - Development time
- **Risk**: Low (18) - Fixing existing feature
- **Alignment**: Critical (10) - Software quality is #1 priority
- **Total**: 93 → **APPROVE IMMEDIATELY - HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**This comes before ANY other initiative.**

### Example 2: Hire Support AI
- **Impact**: High (30) - Improves customer support
- **Cost**: Low (25) - $30/month
- **Risk**: Low (18) - Proven AI employee model
- **Alignment**: High (9) - Supports customer success
- **Software Quality**: Good (10) - Software is working well
- **Total**: 92 → **APPROVE** (but only if software quality is solid)

### Example 2: Major Infrastructure Upgrade
- **Impact**: High (35) - Improves performance
- **Cost**: High (5) - $150/month (at limit)
- **Risk**: Medium (12) - Some migration risk
- **Alignment**: High (8) - Supports growth
- **Total**: 60 → **CONSULT BOARD** (high cost, at limit)

### Example 3: Experimental Feature
- **Impact**: Medium (20) - Unknown impact
- **Cost**: Medium (20) - $500/month
- **Risk**: High (5) - Unproven approach
- **Alignment**: Medium (6) - Somewhat aligned
- **Total**: 51 → **DEFER** (high risk, low score)

## Decision Logging

All decisions must be logged with:
- Decision type
- Reasoning
- Input from board members
- Expected impact
- Timeline
- Success metrics

## Review Process

- Review decisions weekly
- Assess actual vs expected impact
- Learn and improve
- Adjust framework as needed
